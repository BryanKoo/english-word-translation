Build dictionary for English vocabulary learning

Vocabulary learning is one of the first thing to do for learning any foreign languages.

If vocabulary learning content is based on simple data structure as follows.
* word of the foreign laguage (string)
  * meaning of the word (image and/or string)
  * the example phrases/sentence in the foreign language (string and/or image)
  * meaning of the word in the native language (string)

Only one of the four records are in the native language and the other three can be reused for any other native languages.
If we have English vocabulary learning content for Korean, for examplem it is relatively easy to create vocabulary learning content for Japaese.

With this project I am going to build a English to Japanese dictionary for Leedovoca, a famous English vocabulary learning content for Korean.
